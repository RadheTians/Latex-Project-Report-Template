\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap1}

Teleconferencing or Chatting, is a method of using technology to bring people and ideas “together” despite of the geographical barriers.  The technology has been available for years but the acceptance it was quit recent.  Our project is an example of a chat server.  It is made up of two applications the client application, which runs on the user’s Pc and server application, which runs on any Pc on the network.  To start chatting client should get connected to server where they can practice two kinds of chatting, public one (message is broadcasted to all connected users) and private one (between any two users only) and during the last one security measures were taken and as well as best recent popular news and their descriptions.

\section{Gantt chart}
For the completion of any work we need to plan and divide the work in some time frame.I
divided my work according to the following Gantt Chart.

The above chart describes the time frame of simultaneous phases of the project. The
first phases is the analysis phase, in which I completed the analysis of the existing Social Media Apps like WhatsApp,Messanger,Instagram. The second phase is the design phase, in which I completed the database design, interface design of the application. The third phase is the implementation phase, in which I completed the implmentation part by writing the code in JavaScript, XML(eXtensible Markup Language) and JAVA Micro Edition(ME).
