\section{Introduction}\label{chap4:intro}
After study of existing system,software requirements,system analysis and Implementation let us have a look optimum source code acceptable results analysis and their possible test cases.

\section{Source Code}

\section{Result Analysis}
From a proper analysis of positive points and constraints on the component, it can be safely concluded that the product is a highly efficient GUI based component. This application is working properly and meeting to all user requirements. This component can be easily plugged in many other systems.

\subsection{Application Objectives :- }

\begin{enumerate}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{-0.3em}
	\item  \textbf{Improvement in control and performance :}\\ The system is developed to cope up with the current issues and problems with all needed thing are situated to different-different places.
	\item  \textbf{Save cost :}\\ After computerized application is implemented less human force will be required to maintain user information like messages, blog post and most important popular news thus reducing the overall cost.\\
	\item \textbf{Save time :}\\ User is able to search popular news by using few clicks on screen and few search keywords thus saving his valuable time\\
	\item \textbf{Save effort :}\\ In current time people has no such time to cope-up with all possible thing to go at all possible places so that all thing regarding current popular news,messages chat, blog post will come at my proposed project. 
\end{enumerate}


\section{Test Cases}
The aim of the application testing process was to determine all defects in our project .The program was subjected to a set of test inputs and various observations were made and based on these observations it will be decided whether the program behaves as expected or not
